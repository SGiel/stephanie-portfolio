# Stephanie Personal Portfolio

## Description 

This was a code refactor of the Horiseon landing web page. This project re-organized the code following semantic structure and consolidated and reorganized the CSS selectors and properties. In addition, the CSS and HTML code both had descriptive comments added, links were tested and repaired, and accessible alt attributes were added to image elements.
